# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding and utilizing function pointers in C programming. Function pointers are powerful tools that allow us to store and call functions dynamically, enabling more flexible and efficient code design. By working on this project, you will gain a solid understanding of function pointers and their applications in C.

## Project Details
- **Author**: Alexandre Gautier

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

**General**
- Understand what function pointers are and how to use them in C.
- Describe what a function pointer exactly holds.
- Explain where a function pointer points to in the virtual memory.

## Copyright - Plagiarism
Please be aware that this project requires you to come up with your own solutions and achieve the learning objectives independently. Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program. Additionally, publishing any content related to this project is not allowed.

## Requirements
To ensure consistency and compatibility, the following requirements should be followed throughout the project:

**General**
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file must be present at the root of the project folder.
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit. Functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., are forbidden.
- You are allowed to use _putchar.
- No need to push _putchar.c as the reviewer will use their file.
- The prototypes of all functions, including _putchar, should be included in the header file named function_pointers.h.
- Remember to push your header file.
- Use include guards for all header files.

Let's embrace the challenge of learning function pointers and build a solid foundation in this important aspect of C programming! Happy coding!
